You use a while instead of for since you are trying to find the number and will keep repeating until the sequence ends
"Challenge 1: Collatz sequence - while loop for unknown iterations"
To find a prime number and constantly repeat until a prime is found
"Challenge 2: Prime checker - for loop for known range"
Nested loops are important for finding numbers inside of numbers, outer
"Challenge 3: Multiplication grid - nested loop for 2D data"
Final: I chose each type of loop to help with the code
"Add loop design documentation"
